This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming involving incomplete pattern matching on the `Maybe` type. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, which lacks a case to handle `Nothing`. This omission causes a runtime error when the function receives a `Nothing` value. The solution, provided in `bugSolution.hs`, addresses this by including a comprehensive pattern match, gracefully handling both `Just` and `Nothing` scenarios.
